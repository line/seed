    LINE Seed is LINE’s new font that was created based on the brand’s identity of convenience and friendliness. 
    The word "Seed" represents the idea of growing together with our users, expressing the hope that the seeds planted firmly in LINE’s services will sprout and bear fruit.
    The Japanese typeface, LINE Seed JP, has the same DNA as the LINE Seed fonts in other languages. We adjusted the typeface’s weight and center of gravity based on its balance with the English font so that both give the same impression when used together in one sentence.
    As a result, no extra adjustment is required as the Japanese and English typefaces are already well-balanced with each other.
